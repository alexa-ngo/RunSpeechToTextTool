[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.420]   So even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream.
[00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.500]   It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.
[00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:29.100]   I have a dream, but one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its
[00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.900]   dream.
[00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:45.460]   We hold these choose to be self-evident that all men are created each other.
[00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:54.780]   I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the funds of farmers slaves and
[00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.260]   the funds of farmers slave on them, will be able to sit down together at the table of
[00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.260]   brotherhood.
[00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:12.220]   I have a dream that one day, even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the
[00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:21.060]   heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an
[00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:31.980]   oasis of freedom and justice, I have a dream that my four little children will one day
[00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:37.220]   live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of our skin, but by the content
[00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.380]   of that character.
[00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:49.100]   I have a dream today.
[00:01:49.100 --> 00:02:01.020]   I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama with its vicious racist, with its governor
[00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.140]   having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification.
[00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.660]   One day right now in Alabama, little black boys and black girls will be able to join
[00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.420]   hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.
[00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:24.420]   I have a dream today.
[00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:31.020]   I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, every hill in mountains shall
[00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.940]   be made low, the rough places will be made plain and the crooked places will be made
[00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.980]   straight and the poor of the Lord shall be revealed in all flesh shall see it together.
[00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:49.660]   This is our hope, this is a faith that I go back to the South with, with this faith.
[00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:55.460]   We will be able to hoo out of the mountain of despair, a stone of hope.
[00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:01.980]   With this faith, we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a
[00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.140]   beautiful symphony of brotherhood.
[00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:10.580]   With this faith, we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to
[00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:16.700]   go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one
[00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.260]   day.
[00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:27.100]   This will be the day, this will be the day with all of God's children, be able to sing
[00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:34.980]   with new meaning, my country tears are deep, sweet land of liberty of the our sings, land
[00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:42.660]   of where my fathers died, land of the Pilgrims pride, from every mountainside, left freedom
[00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:50.460]   ring in America is to be a great nation, this must become true, so let freedom ring from
[00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:56.460]   the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire, let freedom ring from the mighty mountains
[00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:03.740]   of New York, let freedom ring from the heightening alligators of Pennsylvania, let freedom ring
[00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:09.860]   from the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado, let freedom ring from the provincial slopes
[00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:18.900]   of California, but not only that, let freedom ring from stone mountain of Georgia, let freedom
[00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:26.540]   ring from lookout mountain of Tennessee, let freedom ring from every hill and mole hill
[00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:36.340]   of Mississippi, from every mountainside, let freedom ring and when this happens, when
[00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:43.140]   we allow freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from
[00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:51.540]   every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children,
[00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:57.420]   not men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to
[00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:04.720]   join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual, free at last, free at last,
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.020]   thank God almighty, free at last.
